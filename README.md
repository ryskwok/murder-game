# Murder Game

## What is the Murder Game?

Murder Game is a fun game played on group trips. Everyone is randomly assigned a target, a random object, and a location: and by the end of the trip you must "murder" your target by handing them the random object in the location. Your target must willingly accept the object and there must be a witness. This is a simple webapp to facilitate the setup process of the game!


## Where does the game originate from?

The game origins are difficult to trace, but historians generally agree that it was popularized by the Kerr family in the Victorian era.
