# Murder Game

## What is the Murder Game?

Murder Game is a fun game that makes great memories for your next trip with friends and family!

The rules are simple: everyone is randomly assigned a target, a random object, and a location. Throughout the trip, your goal is to "murder" your target by handing them the random object in the location. Your target must willingly accept the object and there must be a witness to see it happen.

This is a simple webapp to facilitate the setup of the game.

## Where does the game originate from?

The game origins are difficult to trace, but historians generally agree that it was popularized by the Kerr family in the Victorian era.
